# Machine Learning

| Project | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üè° [AudioAid](https://github.com/allegrasimmons/210afallaudioclassification) | December 2024 | Python, CNNs, TensorFlow Lite, Raspberry Pi | [AudioAid](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2023/audioaid-audio-fall-detection-device), a machine learning-based monitoring device that identifies falls among seniors, enabling them to safely age in place by utilizing sophisticated audio analysis techniques. This project addresses a crucial need given the increasing elderly population, with the device providing real-time fall detection, promoting independence and ensuring the safety of seniors through innovative data science applications and ethical user engagement. |
| üí≠ [Brain Tumor Classification](https://github.com/npatel85/final_project_207) | May 2023 |Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn | Built and evaluated a Multinomial Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying brain tumor images into four categories. Utilizing TensorFlow and Keras for model development, along with SHAP for model interpretability, it demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling image data, augmenting it for robustness, and deploying advanced machine learning techniques for accurate classification and insight into the model's decision-making process. |

# Data Engineering 

| Project | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üí° [Acme Gourmet Meals: Consumer Insights](https://github.com/mids-w205/project-1-allegrasimmons/tree/main) | March 2023 | SQL, AWS, Docker, Anaconda, PostgreSQL, Google Maps API | Developed and orchestrated a comprehensive data analysis project, refining intricate data models and executing SQL queries within a dynamic AWS cloud environment. The project's success was marked by creating advanced visualizations in Python and devising a strategic model to elevate a gourmet meal service's customer insight and engagement. |
| üõç [Acme Gourmet Meals: 3rd Party Sales](https://github.com/mids-w205/project-2-allegrasimmons) | April 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook, Staging Tables, JSON Parsing | Conducted a data wrangling initiative to integrate and analyze sales data from a third-party channel. The goal was to validate and transform raw JSON data into actionable insights through a meticulous pipeline of staging, cleansing, and preliminary analytics to inform strategic decision-making for a gourmet meal delivery proof of concept. |
| üê∂ [Acme Gourmet Meals: Delivery Option](https://github.com/mids-w205/project-3-allegrasimmons) | May 2023 |Python, NoSQL Databases (Neo4j, MongoDB, Redis) Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
